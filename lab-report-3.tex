\textbf{Abstract}\\[12pt]
This expirement aimed to analyze the spectra created using gamma ray spectroscopy using thallium-activated sodium iodide scintillation detectors with radioactive isotopes such as $^{22}$Na, $^{60}$Co, and $^{137}$Cs. The peaks of the $^{22}$Na spectrum were then used to calculate the strength of the sodium source and the relative efficiencies of the detector at the different photopeak energies. Finally, different materials were used between the isotopes and the detector to measure the relation between gamma ray detections and the thickness of the barrier between the source and the detector at different energy levels. We found our isotope of $^{22}$Na had a source strength of $11.77\pm1.81$kBq, as compared to its theoretical $15.09$kBq obtained using the initial source strength as well as the half life of the isotope and the amount of time that has passed from the initial source measurement.

\section{Source Strength Measurements}
	The decay process for $^{22}$Na involves two $511\unit{\keV}$ photons and one $1275\unit{\keV}$ photon. The detector comprises some fraction of the solid angle $\Omega$. The probability of a detection of a $511\unit{\keV}$ and a $1275\unit{\keV}$ photon is
	\begin{equation}
		P(511\unit{\keV}) = 2\Omega\cdot\epsilon(E=511\unit{\keV})
	\end{equation}
	\begin{equation}
		P(1275\unit{\keV}) = \Omega\cdot\epsilon(E=1275\unit{\keV})
	\end{equation}
	thus the probability of the combination sum peak is
	\begin{equation}
		P(1786\unit{\keV}) = P(511\unit{\keV})\cdot P(1275\unit{\keV}) = 2\Omega^2\cdot\epsilon(E=511\unit{\keV})\epsilon(E=1275\unit{\keV})
	\end{equation}
	the rate of detecton for each of the peaks ($R_E$) is a measurable value and is the source strength ($S$) times the probability of the peak. The following measurements were taken over $6600\unit{\s}$:
	\begin{align}
		R_{511} &= 202.56\pm.60\unit{\becquerel}\\
		R_{1275} &= 45.35\pm.32\unit{\becquerel}\\
		R_{1786} &= 0.78\pm.12\unit{\becquerel}
	\end{align}
	which allows the calculation of the ratio of the efficiencies of the detector at different energies
	\begin{equation}
		\frac{\epsilon(E=511\unit{\keV})}{\epsilon(E=1275\unit{\keV})} = \frac{R_{511}}{2R_{1275}} = 2.23\pm.02
	\end{equation}
	and the calculation of the source strength by
	\begin{equation}
		S = \frac{R_{511}\cdot R_{1275}}{R_{1786}} = 11.8\pm1.8\unit{\kilo\becquerel}
	\end{equation}
	where the errors on the measured values arise from subtracting background noise from the gross area in the spectrum and the errors on the calculated values arise from standard error propogation

\section{Gamma Ray Absorption}
	It can be shown through a simple differential calculation that
	\begin{equation}
		I = I_0 e^{\frac{x}{\tau}}
	\end{equation}
	where $\tau$ is a function of the energy/wavelength of the photon. Therefore, by categorizing the data by photopeak energy and plotting the rate of detection by the thickness of the material for each separate material, we can calculate different values of $\tau$ and relate the absorption of the materials to each other.
